# Automatically join Zoom meeting

### Aim

Join online meetings or lessons even though I'm still sleeping :P

Best for meetings that:

1. doesn't require camera turned on

2. are scheduled periodically

3. speaker won't check the attendance

### Before use

1. Turn off camera by default in Zoom settings

2. Configure your computer to wake up if you need to turn it off

### How to use

1. Set `MEETING_ID`, `MY_NAME`, `PASSWORD` in `auto_zoom.py`

2. Add it in Task Scheduler and set the run time
